  "opiskelijaruokalistatDetails": "User count: ~ 20 users daily",
  "opiskelijaruokalistatDescription": "In this project, I integrated the lists of all student restaurant in the Joensuu area into a single view to facilitate the selection of preferred student meals on weekdays. A common view for all student cafeterias was not available, so I decided to take action and implement this for the use of this group of friends and myself. The web application includes a separate frontend and backend. The backend retrieves the data for each cafeteria using the Fazer & CO. (Compass Group) API. The frontend is mainly responsible for presenting the data. The web application is designed primarily for mobile use but also functions well on other devices through a web browser.",
